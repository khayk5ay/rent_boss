1. Download mysql server on my pc - DONE
2. connect to the database - DONE
3. Read info from airbnb into the database
4. create airbnb class
5. add functionality to the class 


SECTION 3:
The focus is going to be west african countries and the listings

In the Extract phase: 
Extract info from the api that an give the following information

Administrative regions
Listings based on administrative divisions
Listings details (I noticed that only listings with 8 digit listing id have any activity on them. Lets see if we can narrow the request don to take only those
)
listing reviews (I noticed that only listings with 8 digit listing id have any activity on them. Lets see if we can narrow the request don to take only those
)
list of countries 
listing locations

In the Transform phase: 

1. For admin info, replce any NULL value in the admn_name to the same as admin1
2. For listing_georef, nothing to transform. it is already good
3. For listing_details, extract some columns from listing details to form listing location table
4. For listing_reviews TBD



Create a data architecture diagram using lucid chart/draw.io
It will include the following:
Data sources: Rapid API for airbnb info
Data destinations: my computer
Data store (databases, data warehouse, or data lake): my SQLServer Database
Data ingestion process (CDC, Kafka, or airbyte/fivetran, etc.)
Staging vs production zones
Critical logics in your pipelines
Automation workflow
Environment/Infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes, Spark Clusters, etc.)
Analytics output if possible (BI dashboards)

I have figured out the database design/schema for the rentboss database. Currently implementiong it in lucid chart.

Figure out a way to get more information from the API, since each call only returns 50 records.
